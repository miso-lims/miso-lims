# 0.2.174

Changes:

Upgrade notes:

 * We have updated MISO to use Flyway 5.2.4. To accomodate this change, you will need to manually
   run the provided SQL script on your database **before** migrating to the new version. Replace
   your database and user names in the follow command if necessary. Be sure to check the
   installation guide as the procedure for
   [migrating the database](https://github.com/miso-lims/miso-lims/blob/develop/docs/_posts/2016-01-11-installation-guide.md#migrating-the-database)
   has been updated. You will also need to upgrade to version 5.2.4 of the
   [Flyway command-line tool](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/#download-and-installation).

   ```
   mysql -D lims -u tgaclims -p < sqlstore/src/main/resources/db/scripts/flyway-upgrade-5.2.4.sql
   ```

 * Duplicate serial numbers are no longer allowed for sequencer partition containers. If you have
   duplicates, they must be fixed **before** migrating to this version. Check for duplicate serial
   numbers using the following query. To fix, ensure that each container has a unique serial
   number.

   ```
   SELECT identificationBarcode, COUNT(containerId)
   FROM SequencerPartitionContainer
   GROUP BY identificationBarcode
   HAVING COUNT(containerId) > 1;
   ```

# 0.2.173

Upgrade notes:

 * Freezer maps can now be served from MISO by placing the files in
`${miso.fileStorageDirectory}/freezermaps/`. While this is intended for freezer maps, anything
placed in this directory will be served as a static resource at
http(s)://<server-addr>/freezermaps/. To support this, the following line must be added to your
ROOT.xml inside the Context element:

```
<Resources allowLinking="true"/>

CONFIG CHANGE: Project-specific links to websites (reports, wiki pages, etc.) outside of 
MISO can be added to Edit Project pages. In order to use this, the link must have a
consistent format so that a link for a specific project can be generated by replacing
a URL placeholder with the project's ID, name, or shortName (e.g. a placeholder of
`http://report-site.info/project-report/{name}` would get resolved to 
`http://report-site.info/project-report/PRO218` for project 218).

This can be configured in `miso.properties` file (usually located at 
`<tomcat-home-directory>/conf/Catalina/localhost/miso.properties`) by adding the property
`miso.project.report.links`, like so:
```
## config for links to external Project report services (displayed on Edit Project page).
## format: <link text>|<URI with placeholders>
## URI placeholders can be any of {id}, {name}, {shortName}, and will be replaced with the corresponding field's value when the Edit Project page is loaded.
## multiple report links can be double-backslash-separated (\\).
miso.run.report.links:External Project Link|http://example.com/{id}\\Another Project Link|http://another-site.com/project/{name}
```

CONFIG CHANGE: Run-specific links to websites (reports, wiki pages, etc.) outside of 
MISO can be added to Edit Run pages. In order to use this, the link must have a 
consistent format so that a link for a specific run can be generated by replacing
a URL placeholder with the run's ID, name, or alias (e.g. a placeholder of
`http://report-site.info/run-report/{alias}` would get resolved to 
`http://report-site.info/run-report/180828_Q0001_0001_AQAAAAAXX` for a run with that alias).

This can be configured in the
`miso.properties` file (usually located at `<tomcat-home-directory>/conf/Catalina/localhost/miso.properties`)
by adding the property `miso.run.report.links`, like so:

```
## config for links to external Run report services (displayed on Edit Run page).
## format: <PlatformType>|<link text>|<URI with placeholders>
## PlatformTypes can be comma-separated in the first field.
## URI placeholders can be any of {id}, {name}, {alias}, and will be replaced with the corresponding field's value when the Edit Run page is loaded.
## multiple report links can be double-backslash-separated (\\).
miso.run.report.links:Illumina,PacBio|External Run Link|http://example.com/{id}\\Illumina|Link For Illumina data|http://another-site.com/run/{name}
```

# 0.2.133

Changes:

 * fix: use java.util.logging instead of slf4j in Flyway migration

BAD: Flyway migration via Flyway command-line tool still fails. Fixed in 0.2.134.

 * Fixed zero-padding when autofilling numbers in bulk tables
 * JIRA Integration for Projects and Runs

CONFIG CHANGE: Flyway migration now requires an extra parameter (`-placheholders.filesDir`) to identify
the directory that file attachments are stored in. The value should match the `miso.fileStorageDirectory`
property in your `miso.properties` file (usually located at 
`<tomcat-home>/conf/Catalina/localhost/miso.properties`). By default, this is `/storage/miso/files/`.
e.g. `flyway ... -placeholders.filesDir=/storage/miso/files/ migrate`

CONFIG CHANGE: JIRA Integration can now be configured in `miso.properties` (usually located at 
`<tomcat-home>/conf/Catalina/localhost/miso.properties`), like in the example below. 

Note that if you are upgrading an existing MISO, the `issuetracker.properties` file that likely already 
exists in your MISO base directory (defaults to `/storage/miso`, and is specified by `miso.baseDirectory` 
in `miso.properties`) may override these new JIRA integration values in `miso.properties`. 
It is advised that you delete `issuetracker.properties` from your MISO base directory, and instead keep this 
configuration in `miso.properties`.
```
# JIRA integration (optional)
# miso.issuetracker.tracker:jira
# miso.issuetracker.jira.baseUrl:https://jira.example.com
# provide *either* OAuth or HTTP Basic Auth config
# miso.issuetracker.jira.oAuthConsumerKey:
# miso.issuetracker.jira.oAuthConsumerSecret:
# miso.issuetracker.jira.oAuthSignatureMethod:
miso.issuetracker.jira.httpBasicAuthUsername:
miso.issuetracker.jira.httpBasicAuthPassword:
```

BAD: Flyway migration via Flyway command-line tool fails due to slf4j logger used in Flyway migration.
Could be remedied by copying slf4j libraries into the flyway/libs dir, but the next release contains a
simpler fix.

DELETE FROM Experiment_Kit;
DELETE FROM Experiment_Run;
