<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/bioinformatics/sequence-informatics/core-bioinformatics/miso/">MISO</a> (<u>M</u>anaging <u>I</u>nformation for <u>S</u>equencing <u>O</u>perations) is the Lab Information Management System developed at <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/">TGAC</a>. Work started on MISO in 2010 and was released to the community as an open-source LIMS on the 31st May 2012. Version 0.2.0 (Neon) was released on 30th August 2013. MISO is heavily modelled upon the submission schemas specified by the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/">SRA</a> and is therefore able to automatically generate and deploy the required XML and data files.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-features">Overview of Features</h2>

<p>Features included in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>BETA Plate support</strong> - 96 and 384-well plates are supported, and can be imported via the new bulk_input spreadsheet.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong> - MISO has received a lot of work into improving ehcache integration and reducing heap size. It’s <em><strong>much</strong></em> faster!</li>
  <li><strong>PoolQC support</strong> - Pool objects can now be QCed.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug fixes</strong> - many bugs have been squashed</li>
</ul>

<p>General features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong> – user-centric access control to designated areas Laboratory tracking – project description, sample receipt, library preparation, run construction, and barcoding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Printing</strong> – can directly connect to barcode printers and print barcodes for the relevant objects inside MISO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bioinformatics pipelines</strong> – monitoring and reporting of analytical processes, interacting directly with the computing cluster</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reporting</strong> – personalised and filtered accurate statistics from library preparation and sequencing processes and including graphical visualisations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Visualisation</strong> – through “traffic light” indicators, tree-structured status diagrams and statistics graphs and plots, MISO can easily show the status of each project and its elements by interactive tree and <span class="spell">dendrogram, as well as calendar-based sequencer resource diagrams and run statistics, all using the JavaScript graphing library d3.js.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Submission</strong> – automated packaging of sequencing data and metadata, deployment of these data to remote public repositories (i.e. EBI)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Notification</strong> – automated import of run metadata and notification of change of run status</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>Full model and implementation documentation can be found in the <a href="http://confluence.tgac.bbsrc.ac.uk/">Developer Manual</a>. Some brief MISO facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Currently MySQL underpins MISO. Object relational mapping (ORM) via data access objects (DAOs) is achieved through Spring’s JDBC Templates, which enable fine-grained control over queries over the underlying database.</li>
  <li>Simple Java beans, or Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) are used to represent the model objects in the database, and we construct concrete relationships between them in business logic space.</li>
  <li>We have developed a RESTful web application from the Spring 3 MVC framework and, as such, MISO can support a number of view technologies. It comes with a user-friendly interface built on Java Server Pages (JSP) which is designed specifically for lab technicians, but can be queried programmatically using the REST URLs. This means helpful web services, such as remote custom reporting and integration with other tools and instrumentation, are available.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">D3.js</a> is used for much of the graphical data visualisation in MISO.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<ul>
  <li>MISO has been developed by the <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/bioinformatics/sequence-informatics/core-bioinformatics/">Core Bioinformatics Team</a> at TGAC since February 2010 under leadership of Dr. Robert Davey.</li>
  <li>The first version of MISO (version 0.1.1, Hydrogen) was released internally to TGAC staff on 19th Sept 2011. Each month brings a new version with novel features and bug fixes. The latest internal release was on 30-06-2012 Version: 0.1.6 (Carbon), and this release represents what will be the first beta community release of MISO.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>MISO is open-source beta software at present, and is freely available for usage and modification according to the GNU Public Licence V3 (GPL3).</li>
  <li>We use freely available open-source tools to develop MISO and, in turn, MISO is fully open-source.</li>
  <li>The Spring framework enables us to supply configurations via XML files, so functionality changes are possible without any code changes. For example, replacing a MySQL database model with Postgres or replacing the authentication mechanism is possible with minimal configuration.</li>
  <li>Coupled with the open-source ethos of community development, MISO can make for a cost-effective, highly modifiable and robust system that can benefit both the public knowledge repositories and sequencing centres of all sizes.</li>
  <li>We are actively working on MISO to provide more features, and to support more sequencing platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="installation-and-running-miso">Installation and running MISO</h2>

<h2 id="alerts">Alerts</h2>

<h3 id="my-alerts">My Alerts</h3>

<p>MISO has an alerting system whereby users can watch singular elements or whole groups of elements and receive alerts about them. Depending on the way MISO is configured, you will either receive internal MISO alerts, accessed through the My Account tab, via email, or both.</p>

<h4 id="project-alerts">Project Alerts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To receive Project level alerts, you will need to be one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>watching a singluar Project by selecting <em>Watch</em> in the Option menu of a Project</li>
      <li>the owner of a Project</li>
      <li>in the ProjectWatchers group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="run-alerts">Run Alerts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To receive Run level alerts, you will need to be one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>watching a singluar Run by selecting <em>Watch</em> in the Option menu of a Project</li>

      <li>be the owner of a Pool</li>
      <li>in the PoolWatchers group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="recent-activity-alerts">Recent Activity Alerts</h3>

<p>If you are and Administrator, you will be able to see the list of recently generated system level alerts. This represents a traceable timeline of events for given elements, and future versions of MISO will be able to utilise these events to build up graphical representations of project flow.</p>

<h2 id="cache-administration">Cache Administration</h2>

<h4 id="flush-all-caches">Flush All Caches</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Flushing all caches can be use to clear all the locally stored POJO objects in memory. This is useful if an administrator has changed a reference value (i.e. a Sample alias) manually in the underlying database where the original value would still be held in the in-memory cache.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="view-cache-stats">View Cache Stats</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The statistics of each of the caches can be viewed by clicking this link.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="regenerate-barcodes">Regenerate Barcodes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Generates all the barcodes again in the storage area on disk from the barcode strings of each relevant barcodable object.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reindex-alert-managers">Reindex Alert Managers</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The MISO alerting system keeps a copy of objects watched by the alerting system. This also helps MISO in being able to form an index of these objects for fast searching. This link will reindex all objects held by this system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuring-sequencer-references">Configuring Sequencer References</h2>

<p>Sequencer References represent the link between a physical sequencer and MISO, and are essential for the input of Runs into the system.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-a-sequencer-reference">Viewing a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The All Sequencer References page shows the currently available sequencers linked to MISO.</li>
  <li>By clicking on the <em>View</em> link of a sequencer reference, all the runs performed on that machine can be seen with corresponding name, health, date and status.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding-a-sequencer-reference">Adding a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When a new sequencer reference is to be added, click on the <em>Add Sequencer Reference</em> link in the top-right of the All Sequencer References page.</li>
  <li>A new row will be added to the table, where an ID for the instrument will be generated automatically.</li>
  <li>A unique name <strong>must</strong> be supplied for the sequencer reference, and it <strong>must be</strong> the manufacturer specified name of this instrument, e.g. for an Illumina run folder 120313_SN319_0209_AD0HPAACXX, the sequencer reference name would be SN319. If the name is incorrect here, the notification system will not be able to automatically add runs to MISO.</li>
  <li>Select a platform for the instrument</li>
  <li>Set the hostname of the machine. This will either be the head node PC of a given sequencer, or more likely the hostname of a cluster or compute area where the run folders for this instrument are stored on local disk.</li>
  <li>If the hostname is available on the network, then it will show as OK in the Available column.</li>
  <li>Add the instrument to MISO by clicking on the <em>Add</em> link.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="editing-a-sequencer-reference">Editing a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Editing a sequencer reference allows the administrator to change the instrument information such as the name and hostname.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="working-with-miso">Working with MISO</h1>

<p>In MISO, Project elements are the heart of the system, and comprise many components. All elements are interconnected, based on models designed from the submission schemas specified by the SRA.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>

<p>A MISO project is a collection of studies, samples, and libraries. Each project has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The project ID becomes the suffix of the project’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>PRO1, PRO2</strong>. The project name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any project is **<a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/project/</a><project_id>**.</project_id></p>

<h4 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h4>

<ul>

<h2 id="library">Library</h2>

<p>A MISO sample represents <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">the first step in constructing sequenceable material from an initial Sample. A Library is then diluted down to a Dilution, and put in a Pool.. Each library has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The library ID becomes the suffix of the library’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>LIB1, LIB2</strong>. The library name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any library is **<a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/library/</a><library_id>**.</library_id></span></p>

<h4 id="adding-libraries-1">Adding Libraries</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A Library is related to a specific Sample and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>identification</strong> <strong>barcode</strong>.</li>

  <li>Click on the <em>Construct new Pool using this dilution…</em> link to go to the Pool Wizard.</li>
  <li>Please see the Pool Wizard documentation below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pool">Pool</h2>

<p>A MISO Pool contains one or more Dilutions that are to be placed, as part of an Experiment, in a sequencer instrument Run partition (lane/chamber). Pools with more than one Dilution are said to be multiplexed. Each pool has a <em>prefix</em> based on the Platform Type and an <em>ID</em>. For Illumina pools, the prefix will be <strong>IPO</strong>, for 454 <strong>LPO</strong>, for SOLiD <strong>SPO</strong>. The pool ID becomes the suffix of the pool name_,_ e.g. <strong>IPO1, LPO270</strong>. The pool name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any pool is <strong><a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/pool/</a>&lt;platform_type_in_lower_case&gt;/&lt;pool_ID&gt;</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="creating-pools">Creating Pools</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A Pool is related to a specific Experiment and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>identification</strong> <strong>barcode</strong>.</li>
  <li>On creation, the Pool ID and name will be auto-generated.</li>
  <li>Add in a Pool alias, concentration and creation date.</li>
  <li>Check the Ready to Run checkbox if this Pool is ready to be run on a sequencer, i.e. no more dilutions need to be added.</li>
  <li>If an Experiment has already been created for this Pool, use the _Search Experiments_field to find valid Experiments based on the name, description or related project.
    <ul>
      <li>Once found, click on the Experiment to link it to the Pool.</li>
      <li>A pool can be linked to multiple experiments to denote a multiplexed pool comprising dilutions from different projects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an Experiment has <strong>NOT</strong> been created for this Pool, you can automatically create one simply by adding the pool to a Run partition, and selecting the related study/ies. An Experiment will then be auto-generated for you for each Study.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>NB</strong> This process requires that at least one Study is present for each of the projects related to this Pool via the prepared Samples.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add Dilutions to the Pool by:
    <ul>
      <li>Using the <em>Search Dilution</em> field to find valid Dilutions based on the name, description or related project</li>
      <li>Using the <em>Select Dilutions by Barcodes</em> to beep in multiple ID barcodes of dilutions to be added. Barcodes should be on separate lines. Once all dilutions have bene beeped in, click <em>Select</em> to add them.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Using the <em>Select Dilutions by Barcode File</em> chooser to upload a file with dilution barcodes in. Barcodes should be on separate lines within the file.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>NB</strong> Dilutions can only be added to the same Pool if the parent Library objects have different Tag Barcodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Both Experiments and Dilutions can be removed from the Pool at any time by clicking on the cross icon on the right of the Experiment or Dilution, and confirming the resulting dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pool-operations">Pool Operations</h4>

<p>Once a Pool has been saved, the following operations are available when visiting the Edit Pool page, via clicking on a Pool’s <em>Edit</em> link in any relevant listing table, e.g. from the List Pools page, or the Pools table in a relevant Project.</p>

<h2 id="study">Study</h2>

<p>A MISO study represents more fine-grained information about the sequencing Project. Each study has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The study ID becomes the suffix of the study name_,_ e.g. <strong>STU1, STU2</strong>. The study name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators.

  <li>Studies can contain any number of sequencing Experiments.</li>
  <li>Select <em>Add Experiment</em> to start adding Experiments following the documentation below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>

<p>A MISO Experiment represents design information about the sequencing experiment. Each Experiment has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The Experiment ID becomes the suffix of the Experiment’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>EXP1, EXP2</strong>. The Experiment name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any Experiment is <strong><a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/experiment/</a>&lt;experiment_ID&gt;</strong>.</p>

<p>Experiments are associated with Pools that are placed on Run partitions, which contain the actual sequencing results.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-experiment-creation">Automatic Experiment Creation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst MISO supports creating Experiments manually (see below), it is often easier to allow MISO to generate and link an Experiment to a Pool for you.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Edit Run</em> page, you are able to select Pools to be placed on Run partitions (lanes/chambers).</li>
  <li>When assigning a Pool to a partition, the following rules apply for Experiment creation:
    <ul>
      <li>If the Pool has no Experiment already linked</li>
      <li>If there is at least one Study available on each of the Projects represented by the Pool’s dilutions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If these rules are valid, drop boxes will appear for each represented Project, letting you choose the Study on which to base the automatic Experiment creation.</li>
  <li>Upon clicking <em>Select</em> for each Study, one Experiment will be automatically created and linked to the Pool.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="add-experiment-manually">Add Experiment Manually</h4>

<ul>
  <li>An Experiment is related to a specific Study and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>An Experiment alias cannot contains reserved characters or spaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add in an Experiment title, alias, and description.</li>
  <li>Specify the platform to which this Experiment is related.</li>
  <li>Selecting the Platform will populate a list of available Pools to link to this Experiment.</li>
  <li>Double click to add a chosen Pool to this Experiment.</li>
  <li>Double clicking again on the chosen Pool area will remove it.</li>
  <li>Permissions for each Experiment are inherited from the parent Study</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="partition-containers">Partition Containers</h2>

<p>Partition Containers represent a collection of Partitions (abstractions of lanes, chambers, etc) that are described by a parent Run object. Containers can be populated prior to a Run being entered manually or being imported by the Notification System. This means Containers can be barcoded and entered into MISO with their Pools populated ahead-of-time so that when Runs are added manually or automatically, the Containers can either be linked via a quick lookup or automatically, respectively.</p>

<h4 id="adding-partition-containers-outside-a-run">Adding Partition Containers (outside a Run)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Independent Container creation is accessed from the <em>Create New Partition Container</em> link in the navigation area</li>
  <li>Select a Platform for the Container from the <em>Platform</em> radio buttons</li>
  <li>Select an available Sequencer Reference from the <em>Sequencer</em> dropdown</li>
  <li>Select the number of Containers you want to add for the Platform (454 is the only multiple flowcell vendor. HiSeq’s are effectively “single flowcell in twos”, i.e. two run folders are created independently even though two flowcells can be run concurrently on the machine itself).</li>
  <li>Enter in an ID for this Container. You can validate that this barcode hasn’t been used before by using the <em>Lookup</em> button.</li>
  <li>A location and validation barcode can also be entered, but are not compulsory.</li>
  <li>Double click on an empty partition and either beep in or type the barcode of the pool you wish to add to this Container</li>
  <li>Click on the <em>Save</em> button to save.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adding-partition-containers-within-a-run">Adding Partition Containers (within a Run)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Containers can also be created and edited from within a Run itself and the process is very similar to the above.</li>
  <li>Select the number of Containers you want to add for the Platform (454 is the only multiple flowcell vendor. HiSeq’s are effectively “single flowcell in twos”, i.e. two run folders are created independently even though two flowcells can be run concurrently on the machine itself).</li>
  <li>Enter in an ID for this Container. You can validate that this barcode hasn’t been used before by using the <em>Lookup</em> button.</li>
  <li>A location and validation barcode can also be entered, but are not compulsory.</li>
  <li>Pools are added to Container partitions from the Pool list on the right hand side of the page by double clicking on a Pool</li>
  <li><strong>NB</strong> the chosen Pools will be added <strong>sequentially</strong> to the Container, as by this point, MISO will assess that as the run is already started, it should be fully populated.</li>
  <li>If you wish to retrospectively semi-populate a Container, use the method in the previous section (“outside a Run”).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>

<p>A MISO Run contains the sequencing results from sequencing experiments. Each Run comprises one or more Partition Containers, that in turn comprise Partitions (abstractions of lanes, chambers, etc) which hold a Pool. The Run ID becomes the suffix of the Run name_,_ e.g. <strong>RUN1, RUN2</strong>. The Run name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any Run is <strong><a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/run/</a>&lt;run_ID&gt;</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-run-notification">Automatic Run Notification</h4>

<p>MISO is bundled with a separate Java application that can be run on a machine with access to sequencer run folders. This Notification module allows MISO to be informed about new Runs without any involvement from a user, making it far simpler to manage Runs within MISO. More information on this system can be found in the relevant Notification System section.</p>

<h4 id="adding-a-run-manually">Adding a Run Manually</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A Run is related to Projects via the pooled Samples placed on its partitions and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong>.</li>
  <li>An ID and name will be auto-generated for the Run upon saving.</li>
  <li>Select a Platform Type.</li>
  <li>Select a Sequencer Reference
    <ul>
      <li>Once a Sequencer Reference has been selected, you will be able to select and populate the Container(s). Please follow the information in the Partition Containers section above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Run alias, which should be the run name specified by the sequencer system, and usually relates to a run folder of the same name on the underlying filesystem of use.</li>
  <li>A Run description, giving a brief overview of what the Run represents.</li>
  <li>The Run path, which should be the run folder exposed by the sequencer itself or an intermediary storage filesystem or cluster.</li>
  <li>Check the Paired End checkbox if the Run is paired end.</li>
  <li>Select the current Run status.</li>
  <li>Click on <em>Save</em> to save the Run.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="run-operations">Run Operations</h4>

<p>Once a Run has been saved, either manually or via the Notification System, the following operations are available when visiting the Edit Run page, via clicking on a Run’s <em>Edit</em> link in any relevant listing table, e.g. from the List Runs page, or the Runs table in a relevant Project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edit alias and description</li>
  <li>Choose if the Run is paired end</li>
  <li>Setting the Status of the Run manually
    <ul>
      <li>This is also helpful if the notification system fails to accurately record the status of a Run (some platforms don’t expose this information in a coherent fashion).</li>

<h1 id="submissions">Submissions</h1>

<p>MISO has an automated submission feature, enabling you to quickly and easily submit your sequence meta data to public repositories such as the EBI. MISO will automatically generate the required XML documents based on the information already stored in the system, and submit these to the repository. MISO can also be configured to initiate upload of your actual sequence data.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-new-submissions">Preparing new Submissions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To prepare a new Submission, go to the <em>My Account</em> tab, and choose <em>Prepare new Submission</em>.</li>
  <li>Enter a title, alias and description for your submission in the appropriate boxes.</li>
  <li>Choose the action for the submission from the options: Add, Modify, suppress, Hold, Release, Close, Protect or Validate.</li>
  <li>You can now choose which elements you want to submit:
    <ul>
      <li>From the list of Projects, clicking on any of these will reveal a drop-down list of submittable elements.</li>
      <li>Check the boxes next to the elements you wish to submit, and click <em>Save</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="previewing-validating-and-submitting-metadata">Previewing, Validating and Submitting Metadata</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have saved your Submission, you will see links to either Preview, Validate or Submit your submission metadata.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Preview</strong> will show you a condensed version of the metadata in a new browser window.</li>
      <li><strong>Validate</strong> will generate the submission XMLs and send them to the EBI validation service. Any problems with the XMLs will be displayed in the browser window - errors in Red and information in Yellow. The actual metadata will be displayed below these warnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Submit Metadata</strong> will start the metadata submission process. This will also be validated, and will fail, displaying error messages if the XML is invalid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="submitting-sequence-data">Submitting Sequence Data</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have saved your Submission, you will see a link to submit your sequence data.</li>
  <li>MISO has a number of mechanisms to find data files based on the platform and submittable elements selected.</li>
  <li>These mechanisms should be suitable for most platforms outputting data to standard locations. If not, please see the Developer Manual section on writing custom FilePathGenerators.</li>
  <li>MISO also has mechanisms for uploading data to submission endpoints, e.g. the EBI SRA. MISO ships with a built-in FTP upload feature that will connect to an FTP server and upload datafiles. We are currently working on implementing other, faster upload methods such as ASPERA.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="list-submissions">List Submissions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Choose <em>List Submissions</em> from the admin area to see a list of all submissions that have been created so far, along with their status. You can edit any of these by clicking the <em>Edit</em> link.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notification-server">Notification Server</h1>

<p>The Notification Server module for MISO collects up sequencer run information from a given set of datapaths (directories on a filesystem) and sends that information to MISO in a simple JSON format, which consumes it and automatically creates and updates Run objects as necessary.</p>

<h3 id="installing">Installing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Grab the notification-server jar from the MISO repos site: <a href="https://repos.tgac.ac.uk/miso/release/notification-server-0.1.9.one-jar.jar">https://repos.tgac.ac.uk/miso/release/notification-server-0.2.0.one-jar.jar</a></li>
  <li>Grab <strong>example-notification.properties</strong> and <strong>run_notification_server.sh</strong> from <a href="https://repos.tgac.ac.uk/miso/common/">https://repos.tgac.ac.uk/miso/common/</a></li>
  <li>Copy everything to a machine that has access to your sequencer’s run folders.
    <ul>
      <li>For example, at TGAC we run it on a specialised virtual machine that has the output folders mounted as a network share. You could just as easily run this module on a cluster head node, or indeed an actual sequencer control PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Copy the <strong>example-notification.properties</strong> to a new file called <strong>notification.properties</strong>.</li>
  <li>Edit the information in the properties file to match your desired configuration. See <em>Configuring</em> below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configuring">Configuring</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The supported platforms are: <strong>illumina, solid, ls454, pacbio</strong>. Each subsequent property is demarcated by this platform identifier.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>wiretap.enabled</strong>:false
        <ul>
          <li>Enabling this global option will give you very verbose output about what is getting packaged up and sent to the MISO server. Only turn this on if you like lots of eye-burning developer output.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>illumina.dataPaths</strong>:/path/to/your/illumina/run/folders
        <ul>
          <li>Set this property to one or more (comma separated) paths on the filesystem where your Illumina run folders are stored.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>illumina.http.statusEndpointURIs</strong>:<a href="http://your.miso.server/miso/consumer/illumina/run/status">http://your.miso.server/miso/consumer/illumina/run/status</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Set this property to one or more (comma separated) URLs that represent endpoints to send the run information to. This is usually a MISO install, but could be any JSON endpoint you choose. Please see the Developer Documentation for the JSON schema if you want to develop your own endpoints.</li>

<h3 id="running">Running</h3>

<p>Simply run the <strong>run_notification_server.sh</strong> shell script. We usually do this in a <strong>screen</strong> (*nix) so you can detach the process and come back to it later on. If you are on Windows, knock up a quick batch script that does the same thing!</p>

<h1 id="analysis-server">Analysis Server</h1>

<p>The Analysis Server module enables MISO to perform workflows as simple pipeline tasks, comprising one or more processes, and fire these off to an LSF machine. This code is heavily based on the ArrayExpress Conan architecture, developed at the EBI by Tony Burdett.</p>
