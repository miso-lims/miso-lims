# MISO Github pages

MISO's documentation is built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
and hosted by [readthedocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).


## Prerequisites

Install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).


## Test and deploy locally

To test out changes locally, run:

```
mkdocs serve -f .mkdocs.yml
```

The pages will be likely be hosted at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000),
though be sure to check the output in case it hosts at another address or port.


## Readthedocs configuration

[../.readthedocs.yml](../.readthedocs.yml). It should build automatically.
Launch a build manually (or do other configuration by going to
