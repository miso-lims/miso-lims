Run Scanner is a service that scans run directories on the file system and serves run metadata via a REST interface.
MISO features integration with Run Scanner, allowing MISO to retrieve run data from Run Scanner and automatically
create and update runs in MISO.

Pinery is a REST webservice for serving LIMS data, mainly for consumption by other applications. Pinery is used as an
abstraction layer to prevent other applications from depending on a specific LIMS' schema. This means that you can
write applications to consume Pinery data, and then if you ever want to use a different data source, such as another
LIMS, you just need a Pinery implementation for that data source and all of your existing applications will remain
compatible.

Documentation for Pinery can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/pinery). Documentation for
the MISO implementation of Pinery can be found in
[MISO's GitHub repository](https://github.com/TGAC/miso-lims/tree/develop/pinery-miso).
