# Notes

Notes can be used to add additional information to an item that is not otherwise represented in MISO. Because this
additional data is not specific or controlled, notes are not meant to hold data that would be used for analysis or any
automated systems. They are intended to hold informational data that can be read by MISO users. The following items can
have notes added to them.

* Samples
* Libraries
* Pools
* Sequencer Runs

# Adding Notes

Notes can be added from the single Edit page for an item. For example, you would go to the Edit Sample page to add
notes to a sample, or the Edit Run page to add notes to a sequencer run. On the Edit pages, there is a Notes section.
In the Options menu to the right of the "Notes" heading, click "Add Note." In the dialog that appears, select "Internal
Only" if you would like the note to be hidden from external collaborators that have MISO access. Enter the text you
would like for the note and click the "Add Note" button. The new note will appear in the Notes section showing the date
it was added, the note's text, and the user who created it.



## Deleting Notes

To delete a note, find it in the Notes section of the Edit page for the item it belongs to. Click the trash can icon on
the right side of the note entry. Notes can only be deleted by the person who created them, or by a MISO administrator.
