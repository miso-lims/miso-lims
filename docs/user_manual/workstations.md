# Workstations

Workstations describe the areas where library preparation is completed. To get to the Workstations list page, click
"Workstations" near the bottom of the "Misc" menu on the left side of the screen. MISO administrators can create, edit,
and delete workstations using the standard interface described in the [Type Data section](../type_data/).
