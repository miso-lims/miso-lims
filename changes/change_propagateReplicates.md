Improvements when propagating samples and choosing to specify replicates per sample:
* The inputs are now sorted by parent sample alias.
* Multiple values separated by line breaks can now be pasted to overwrite multiple inputs in the
  dialog. This allows copying from a text document or spreadsheet column.
