If you use any box scanners with MISO, you will need to update your `miso.properties`. The `miso.
visionmate.servers` property has been renamed to `miso.boxscanner.servers` and its format has 
changed to include the scanner type. See [site-configuration](https://miso-lims.readthedocs.io/projects/docs/en/latest/admin/site-configuration/#miso.boxscanner.servers) for more details.
