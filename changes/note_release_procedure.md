The bare metal install/upgrade procedure has been simplified, as required files are now available
for download on the GitHub release page. See the
[Install Guide](https://miso-lims.readthedocs.io/projects/docs/en/latest/admin/baremetal-installation-guide/).
The old procedure can still be used if you prefer to build from source.
