Considering the addition of kits on library aliquots, you may want to redesign some of your
existing kits in MISO. For example, if you were previously using a single kit to represent two
separate kits that are used during library preparation, you may want to instead use two separate
MISO kits - one on the library, and one on the library aliquot. To ensure the validity of
existing data, the upgrade will copy the library kit to the library aliquot for any existing
aliquot that has a targeted sequencing option selected.
