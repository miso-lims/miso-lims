<h1 id="working-with-miso">Working with MISO</h1>

<p>In MISO, Project elements are the heart of the system, and comprise many components. All elements are interconnected, based on models designed from the submission schemas specified by the SRA.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>

<p>A MISO project is a collection of studies, samples, and libraries. Each project has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The project ID becomes the suffix of the project’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>PRO1, PRO2</strong>. The project name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h3>

<h3 id="adding-a-project-overview">Adding a Project Overview</h3>

<p>A Project Overview represents the portion of work to be done on a particular number of samples for a particular collaborator. Once an overview has been added, this portion of the project work can now be tracked via the alerting system, and will be reflected in the progress indicator.</p>

<h2 id="study">Study</h2>

<p>A MISO study represents more fine-grained information about the sequencing Project. Each study has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The study ID becomes the suffix of the study name_,_ e.g. <strong>STU1, STU2</strong>. The study name is programatically constructed to be unique and as such is unchangeable by any user, including administrators. The URL address for viewing any study is <strong><a href="http://your.miso.host/miso/project/">http://your.miso.host/miso/study/</a>&lt;study_ID&gt;</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-study">Creating a study</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A study is related to a specific Project and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong>.</li>
  <li>Add in a Study description, outlining perhaps the origin and purpose of this Study.</li>
  <li>Add a Study alias.
    <ul>
      <li>A Study alias cannot contains reserved characters or spaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Specify the type of this Study.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="edit-study">Edit Study</h4>

<p>Once a Study has been saved, the following operations are available when visiting the Edit Study page, via clicking on a Study’s <em>Edit</em> link in any relevant listing table, e.g. from the List Studies page, or the Studies table in a relevant Project.</p>

<h4 id="adding-experiments">Adding Experiments</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Studies can contain any number of sequencing Experiments.</li>
  <li>Select <em>Add Experiment</em> to start adding Experiments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>

<p>A MISO Experiment represents design information about the sequencing experiment. Each Experiment has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The Experiment ID becomes the suffix of the Experiment’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>EXP1, EXP2</strong>.</p>

<p>Experiments are associated with Pools that are placed on Run lanes, which contain the actual sequencing results.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-experiment-creation">Automatic Experiment Creation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst MISO supports creating Experiments manually (see below), it is often easier to allow MISO to generate and link an Experiment to a Pool for you.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Edit Run</em> page, you are able to select Pools to be placed on Run lanes (lanes/chambers).</li>
  <li>When assigning a Pool to a lane, the following rules apply for Experiment creation:
    <ul>
      <li>If the Pool has no Experiment already linked</li>
      <li>If there is at least one Study available on each of the Projects represented by the Pool’s dilutions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If these rules are valid, drop boxes will appear for each represented Project, letting you choose the Study on which to base the automatic Experiment creation.</li>
  <li>Upon clicking <em>Select</em> for each Study, one Experiment will be automatically created and linked to the Pool.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="add-experiment-manually">Add Experiment Manually</h4>

<ul>
  <li>An Experiment is related to a specific Study and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>An Experiment alias cannot contains reserved characters or spaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add in an Experiment title, alias, and description.</li>
  <li>Specify the platform to which this Experiment is related.</li>
  <li>Selecting the Platform will populate a list of available Pools to link to this Experiment.</li>
  <li>Double click to add a chosen Pool to this Experiment.</li>
  <li>Double clicking again on the chosen Pool area will remove it.</li>
  <li>Permissions for each Experiment are inherited from the parent Study</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sample">Sample</h2>

<p>A MISO sample represents the physical material received upon which sample preparation, QC and library preparations are carried out to prepare that sample for eventual sequencing. Each sample has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The sample ID becomes the suffix of the sample’s name, e.g. SAM1, SAM2.</p>

<p>There are two possible categories of samples: plain and detailed. Detailed samples extend the information recorded for plain samples and also permit deriving samples from other samples (for example, extracting DNA from a tissue to produce an analyte). MISO can be configured on startup to use the type of sample best for your institution.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-single-sample">Creating a single sample</h3>
<p>A sample is related to a specific Project and is tracked by a unique alias and identification barcode.</p>

<p><img src="/miso-lims/images/create-sample.png" alt="Create single sample in MISO" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Under <em>Tracking</em>, click <em>List Samples</em>.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Add Sample</em> in the top right hand corner.</li>
  <li>Add in a sample description, outlining perhaps the origin and eventual preparation of this sample.</li>
  <li>Add a sample alias. Sample aliases must conform to a naming convention determined by your institution, e.g. <collaborator_identifier>_S<sample_number_relative_to_parent_project>_<material_identifier>, ABC_S1_H.sapiens</material_identifier></sample_number_relative_to_parent_project></collaborator_identifier></li>
  <li>Specify a receipt date if this sample has already been received. Leave blank if this sample is to be received at a later date, i.e. when the sample delivery form has been returned to your centre.</li>
  <li>Specify a NCBI-valid species name for this sample. If enabled, MISO will check this species with the NCBI and ascribe the returned taxon ID to this sample.</li>
  <li>Specify the type of this sample.</li>
  <li>Lastly, specify whether this sample has passed QC. Please see the Sample QC section on how to add Sample QCs</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em> at the upper right corner of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bulk-sample-creation">Bulk sample creation</h3>
<p>Bulk sample addition is identical to single creation, but in tabular form for ease of adding multiple samples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To start the process, click on <em>Add Row</em> at the top of the table. An empty row will be added.</li>
  <li>Add in the required fields as you would a normal single sample input.</li>
  <li>To copy this row, click the arrow icon in the <em>Copy</em> field of the table. You will see that by default, the <strong>sample_number_relative_to_parent_project</strong> in the sample alias is incremented automatically. To turn this feature off, expand the <em>Table Options</em> section above the table, and deselect the <em>Increment Sample Aliases Automatically</em> option.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can specify a defined number of rows to add immediately by clicking the <em>Bulk Copy</em> button. A dialog will appear asking you how many rows to add. Choose a value, e.g. “96”, and click <em>OK</em>. This will copy the last row in the table <em>x</em> times, incrementing the <strong>sample_number_relative_to_parent_project</strong>.</li>
  <li>To quickly fill down a value in a field to other Samples, fill in the value for the chosen field in an upper row, select that row, and then click the <em>Fill Down</em> arrow button in a column header. All Samples below the chosen row will have the same value applied to that field.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button. You will informed of any rows that did not save.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sample-operations">Sample operations</h3>

<p>Once a Sample has been saved, the following operations are available when visiting the Edit Sample page, via clicking on a sample’s <em>Edit</em> link in any relevant listing table, e.g. from the List Samples page, or the Samples table in a relevant Project.</p>

<h4 id="printing-sample-barcodes">Printing Sample Barcodes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Once a Sample has been saved, a barcode will be generated for it. This will be present in the top right of the screen when editing a Sample.</li>
  <li>Hovering over the barcode will show a menu with the <em>Print</em> option.</li>
  <li>Clicking on this will show a dialog allowing the user to select which printer with which to print the barcode.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Either type, or beep in using a barcode reader, a sample barcode.</li>
  <li>If this sample has no previously set receipt date, it will be added to the list below the input box.</li>
  <li>You can repeat this process for as many samples as you need to receive.</li>
  <li>Once finished inputting, click <em>Save.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="library">Library</h2>

<p>A MISO sample represents the first step in constructing sequenceable material from an initial Sample. A Library is then diluted down to a Dilution, and put in a Pool. Each library has a <em>prefix</em> and an <em>ID</em>. The library ID becomes the suffix of the library’s name_,_ e.g. <strong>LIB1, LIB2</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="adding-single-libraries">Adding single libraries</h4>
<p>A Library is related to a specific Sample and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>identification</strong> <strong>barcode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/miso-lims/images/add-library.png" alt="Add library button" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Under <em>Tracking</em>, click <em>List Samples</em>. Locate the sample that you wish to derive the library from and click on the Sample name.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the Libraries section. Hover over the <em>Options</em> menu at the top right hand corner and click <em>Add Library</em> (see above image)</li>
  <li>Add in a library description, outlining perhaps the origin and eventual preparation of this library.</li>
  <li>The Library alias inherits from the parent Sample, but with some important changes:</li>
  <li>A Library alias must conform to the naming convention determined by your institution, e.g. <collaborator_identifier>_L<parent_sample_number>-<library_number_relative_to_parent_sample>_<material_identifier>. Thus the first Library added to ABC_S1_H.sapiens would have an alias of ABC_L1-1_H.sapiens. The second would be ABC_L1-2_H.sapiens, and so on</material_identifier></library_number_relative_to_parent_sample></parent_sample_number></collaborator_identifier></li>
  <li>The creation date is automatically set to the current date.</li>
  <li>Set the Platform that this Library is being prepared for, the Library type, Library section type, Library strategy type.</li>
  <li>If this Library is to be multiplexed with an adaptor barcode, pick the barcode from the dropdown list available for the selected platform.</li>
  <li>Check the QC Passed checkbox if the library has passed and QC stages.</li>
  <li>Permissions will be inherited from the parent Sample.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> in the upper right corner of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bulk-library-creation">Bulk Library creation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Bulk Library addition is identical to single creation, but in tabular form for ease of adding multiple Libraries.</li>
  <li>You will see the list of Samples associated with the parent Project. These form the basis for Library creation.</li>
  <li>Add in the required fields as you would a normal single Library input.</li>
  <li>Select the samples you wish to use for Library creation by clicking in the <em>Select</em> column so that the row turns blue.</li>
  <li><strong>One</strong> Library will be created for each Sample selected as such in the table.</li>
  <li>To quickly fill down a value in a field to other Libraries, fill in the value for the chosen field in an upper row, select that row, and then click the <em>Fill Down</em> arrow button in a column header. All Libraries below the chosen row will have the same value applied to that field.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button. You will informed of any rows that did not save.</li>

  <li>Click on the <em>Construct new Pool using this dilution…</em> link to go to the Pool Wizard.</li>
  <li>Please see the Pool Wizard documentation below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="library-dilutions-and-pools">Library Dilutions and Pools</h2>

<p>A MISO Pool contains one or more Dilutions that are to be sequenced as part of an Experiment, in a sequencer instrument Run lanes (or chamber). Pools with more than one Dilution are said to be multiplexed. Each pool has a <em>prefix</em> based on the Platform Type and an <em>ID</em>. For Illumina pools, the prefix will be <strong>IPO</strong>, for 454 <strong>LPO</strong>, for SOLiD <strong>SPO</strong>. The pool ID becomes the suffix of the pool name_,_ e.g. <strong>IPO1, LPO270</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="create-library-dilutions">Create library dilutions</h3>

<p>A library dilution is a diluted portion of a library ready to be added to a pool. Usually just represents the process of adding a library to a pool, and is not stored in a tube of its own.</p>

<p><a href="/miso-lims/images/add-dilutions.png"><img src="/miso-lims/images/add-dilutions.png" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <em>My Project</em> tab and select the appropriate project from the list</li>
  <li>Open the <em>Libraries</em> section and then select <em>Add Library Dilutions</em> from the <em>Options</em> menu (see image above)</li>
  <li>Click individual rows under the <em>select</em> header to select the libraries to be used to create library dilutions. Clicking the <em>Select</em> heading will select all the rows.</li>
  <li>Select the date of the dilution from the first selected row and choose it from the calendar. If all the dates are the same you can choose the down arrow beside the Dilution Date header to fill in the rest of the rows with the same date value.</li>
  <li>Fill in the concentration files one at a time</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save Dilutions</em> in the upper right hand corner.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-pools">Creating Pools</h3>
<p>A pool is one or more diluted libraries inside a tube that is loaded onto a sequencing container. A Pool is related to a specific Experiment and is tracked by a unique alias and identification barcode.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <em>My Project</em> tab and select the appropriate project from the list</li>
  <li>Open the <em>Library Dilutions</em> section and select <em>Create Pools</em> from the Options menu.</li>
  <li>Add in a Pool alias and final concentration</li>
  <li>To facilitate making multiple pools at the same time, select <em>Remove selected dilutions</em> to the dilutions already used from the list. This doesn’t affect the dilution in the database, it just removes it from the list as a convenience so the same dilution wont be selected again.</li>
  <li>Select <em>Create New Pool</em>. The newly created pool shows up on the right.</li>
  <li>Click on the pool to fill in more information:
    <ul>
      <li>Check the Ready to Run checkbox if this Pool is ready to be run on a sequencer, i.e. no more dilutions need to be added.</li>
      <li>Add QCs</li>
      <li>Create orders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sequencing-containers">Sequencing Containers</h2>

<p>Sequencing Containers represent a collection of Lanes (which represent lanes, chambers, etc) that are described by a parent Run object. Containers can be populated prior to a Run being entered manually or being imported by the Notification System. This means Containers can be barcoded and entered into MISO with their Pools populated ahead-of-time so that when Runs are added manually or automatically, the Containers can either be linked via a quick lookup or automatically, respectively.</p>

<h4 id="adding-sequencing-containers-outside-a-run">Adding Sequencing Containers (outside a Run)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Independent Container creation is accessed from the <em>Create New Sequencing Container</em> link in the navigation area</li>
  <li>Select a Platform for the Container from the <em>Platform</em> radio buttons</li>
  <li>Select an available Sequencer from the <em>Sequencer</em> dropdown</li>
  <li>Select the number of Containers you want to add for the Platform (454 is the only multiple-flowcell vendor. HiSeq’s are effectively “single flowcell in twos”, i.e. two run folders are created independently even though two flowcells can be run concurrently on the machine itself).</li>
  <li>Enter in an ID for this Container. You can validate that this barcode hasn’t been used before by using the <em>Lookup</em> button.</li>
  <li>A location and validation barcode can also be entered, but are not compulsory.</li>
  <li>Double click on an empty lane and either beep in or type the barcode of the pool you wish to add to this Container</li>
  <li>Click on the <em>Save</em> button to save.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adding-sequencing-containers-within-a-run">Adding Sequencing Containers (within a Run)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Containers can also be created and edited from within a Run itself and the process is very similar to the above.</li>
  <li>Select the number of Containers you want to add for the Platform (454 is the only multiple flowcell vendor. HiSeq’s are effectively “single flowcell in twos”, i.e. two run folders are created independently even though two flowcells can be run concurrently on the machine itself).</li>
  <li>Enter in an ID for this Container. You can validate that this barcode hasn’t been used before by using the <em>Lookup</em> button.</li>
  <li>A location and validation barcode can also be entered, but are not compulsory.</li>
  <li>Pools are added to Container lanes from the Pool list on the right hand side of the page by double clicking on a Pool</li>
  <li><strong>NB</strong> the chosen Pools will be added <strong>sequentially</strong> to the Container, as by this point, MISO will assess that as the run is already started, it should be fully populated.</li>
  <li>If you wish to retrospectively semi-populate a Container, use the method in the previous section (“outside a Run”).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>

<p>A MISO Run contains the sequencing results from sequencing experiments. Each Run comprises one or more Sequencing Containers, that in turn comprise Lanes (representing lanes, chambers, etc) which hold a Pool.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-run-notification">Automatic Run Notification</h4>

<p>MISO is bundled with a separate Java application that can be run on a machine with access to sequencer run folders. This Notification module allows MISO to be informed about new Runs without any involvement from a user, making it far simpler to manage Runs within MISO. More information on this system can be found in the relevant Notification System section.</p>

<h4 id="adding-a-run-manually">Adding a Run Manually</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A Run is related to Projects via the pooled Samples placed on its lanes and is tracked by a unique <strong>alias</strong>.</li>
  <li>An ID and name will be auto-generated for the Run upon saving.</li>
  <li>Select a Platform Type.</li>
  <li>Select a Sequencer Reference
    <ul>
      <li>Once a Sequencer Reference has been selected, you will be able to select and populate the Container(s). Please follow the information in the Sequencing Containers section above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Run alias, which should be the run name specified by the sequencer system, and usually relates to a run folder of the same name on the underlying filesystem of use.</li>
  <li>A Run description, giving a brief overview of what the Run represents.</li>
  <li>The Run path, which should be the run folder exposed by the sequencer itself or an intermediary storage filesystem or cluster.</li>
  <li>Check the Paired End checkbox if the Run is paired end.</li>
  <li>Select the current Run status.</li>
  <li>Click on <em>Save</em> to save the Run.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="run-operations">Run Operations</h4>

<p>Once a Run has been saved, either manually or via the Notification System, the following operations are available when visiting the Edit Run page, via clicking on a Run’s <em>Edit</em> link in any relevant listing table, e.g. from the List Runs page, or the Runs table in a relevant Project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edit alias and description</li>
  <li>Choose if the Run is paired end</li>
  <li>Setting the Status of the Run manually
    <ul>
      <li>This is also helpful if the notification system fails to accurately record the status of a Run (some platforms don’t expose this information in a coherent fashion).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>Add details
    <ul>
      <li>The QC User that carried out the QC.</li>
      <li>The QC date.</li>
      <li>The QC Method relates to a conceptual or practical QC steps undertaken by one of two “actioners”, i.e. SeqOps (<em>sequencing operations</em>) or SeqInfo (<em>sequence informatics</em>). The former is carried out after the physical run has completed and assessed for quality. The latter is carried out following a primary analysis stage to assess quality.</li>
      <li>The Process Selection allows the QC to be related to a given subset of lanes, e.g. if lanes 1-4 were OK and should be processed, but lanes 5-8 were not, boxes 1-4 would be clicked to reflect this.</li>
      <li>Any other free-text information should be added in the Info field.</li>
      <li>Click on <em>Add</em> to save.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="alerts">Alerts</h2>

<h3 id="my-alerts">My Alerts</h3>

<p>MISO has an alerting system whereby users can watch singular elements or whole groups of elements and receive alerts about them. Depending on the way MISO is configured, you will either receive internal MISO alerts, accessed through the My Account tab, via email, or both.</p>

<h4 id="project-alerts">Project Alerts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To receive Project level alerts, you will need to be one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>watching a singluar Project by selecting <em>Watch</em> in the Option menu of a Project</li>
      <li>the owner of a Project</li>
      <li>in the ProjectWatchers group</li>

<h3 id="recent-activity-alerts">Recent Activity Alerts</h3>

<p>If you are and Administrator, you will be able to see the list of recently generated system level alerts. This represents a traceable timeline of events for given elements, and future versions of MISO will be able to utilise these events to build up graphical representations of project flow.</p>

<h2 id="cache-administration">Cache Administration</h2>

<h4 id="flush-all-caches">Flush All Caches</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Flushing all caches can be use to clear all the locally stored POJO objects in memory. This is useful if an administrator has changed a reference value (i.e. a Sample alias) manually in the underlying database where the original value would still be held in the in-memory cache.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="view-cache-stats">View Cache Stats</h4>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="reindex-alert-managers">Reindex Alert Managers</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The MISO alerting system keeps a copy of objects watched by the alerting system. This also helps MISO in being able to form an index of these objects for fast searching. This link will reindex all objects held by this system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuring-sequencer-references">Configuring Sequencer References</h2>

<p>Sequencer References represent the link between a physical sequencer and MISO, and are essential for the input of Runs into the system.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-a-sequencer-reference">Viewing a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The All Sequencer References page shows the currently available sequencers linked to MISO.</li>
  <li>By clicking on the <em>View</em> link of a sequencer reference, all the runs performed on that machine can be seen with corresponding name, health, date and status.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding-a-sequencer-reference">Adding a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When a new sequencer reference is to be added, click on the <em>Add Sequencer Reference</em> link in the top-right of the All Sequencer References page.</li>
  <li>A new row will be added to the table, where an ID for the instrument will be generated automatically.</li>
  <li>A unique name <strong>must</strong> be supplied for the sequencer reference, and it <strong>must be</strong> the manufacturer specified name of this instrument, e.g. for an Illumina run folder 120313_SN319_0209_AD0HPAACXX, the sequencer reference name would be SN319. If the name is incorrect here, the notification system will not be able to automatically add runs to MISO.</li>
  <li>Select a platform for the instrument</li>
  <li>Set the hostname of the machine. This will either be the head node PC of a given sequencer, or more likely the hostname of a cluster or compute area where the run folders for this instrument are stored on local disk.</li>
  <li>If the hostname is available on the network, then it will show as OK in the Available column.</li>
  <li>Add the instrument to MISO by clicking on the <em>Add</em> link.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="editing-a-sequencer-reference">Editing a Sequencer Reference</h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<h1 id="reporting">Reporting</h1>

<p>Reporting in MISO is a very flexible feature, with reports that can be generated based on Projects, Samples, Libraries and Runs. All reports can be filtered by keywords, date range and relevant types.</p>

<h3 id="generating-reports">Generating Reports</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Reports based on different elements can be generated from separate tabs for each, i.e. Project report, Sample Report, Libraries Report and Runs Report</li>
  <li>Each type of report got different filtering options
    <ol>
      <li>All type of reports can be filtered by using keyword for name, alias and description, and dates</li>
      <li>Project reports got extra filter option for Project Progress, i.e. Active, Inactive, Pending, Cancelled, Proposed, completed, Approved, Unknown.</li>
      <li>Samples reports can be filtered based on Samples Type and Sample QC</li>
      <li>Libraries reports filters are Sequencer Platform type and Library QC</li>
      <li>Runs can be filtered based on Run Status, and Sequencers Platform type</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Press the <em>Search</em> button, will give you a list of objects based on filters,</li>
